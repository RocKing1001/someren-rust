# Inholland's database project rewritten in Rust

I absolutely hate C#. I absolutely hate Windows and Winforms.
Not only that, but I have not used windows in the past 4 years, and I would like to keep it that way.
This means I need to spin up a slow shitty virtual machine every time I have to do this stupid project because of Winforms.
So here is that project rewritten in Rust using the GTK toolkit.
Plus, I will be using a simple PostgreSQL database hosted on my vps, because Azure SQL Server is also fucking dumb.
